When you create a plugin you can use our-made events with many variables already set

ONLY for events from LGHBot you have additional elements bot-related
If event comes from a group the "chat" object will contain the full Custom Chat Object (look at documentation.md) by the database (it's identified by isGroup or if callback data contains a groupId)
user.perms (result of api/rolesManager/sumUserPerms()) is avaiable in 3 cases: if chat.isGroup is true, if callback.data contains a groupId, or on message if user.waitingReply is true and user.waitingReplyType contains a groupId
NOTE: user.perms is a temporary item, it's not intended to be saved in the database (database does not save it)
Any "msg" object contains msg.command (result of api/utils/parseCommand(msg.text))

NOTE FOR CALLBACK EVENT: callback event gives you the full chat object only if chat.isGroup is true, if is private chat you should require it yourself from the database

You can find a comment referring security guards that you can use too in plugins/welcome.js
